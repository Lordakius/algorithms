+ Implement the following scheduling algorithms in all languages. Analyse 
their runtime and space. Make a comparison of the runtime and evaluate possible
optimizations. 

The procedure list shall be implemented in linked lists, a static array,
(TODO:insert other data structures)

All algorithms take a pointer to the start of the list (so that they could
potentially handle multiple lists) and a pointer to the currently run thread,
which is NULL if no thread is running. 

They then process the list as the algorithm defines and set the thread state
accordingly

no return value (TODO:maybe error checking, what kind of errors?)
